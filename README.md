# Andrew McCarthy

I am a senior at WashU majoring in Finance and Mathematics+CS.

I like messing around with LLMs and deep learning. I like UX design and making things that make my life easier.

Most of my repos on here are private either because they are in production, in progress or could make me a bunch of money. I am working on making more public repos and contributing to the open source community.
